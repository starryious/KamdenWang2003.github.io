# Hobbies

<br>

## Teaching

<br>

 Teaching is a great way to keep learning. When you are teaching, you will find whether you truly master a specific knowledge or not. [The Feynman Technique](https://www.colorado.edu/artssciences-advising/resource-library/life-skills/the-feynman-technique-in-academic-coaching) is a way to practice this idea. Due to the unsatisfactory teaching of university courses, I want to try my best to teach others by a relaxing but rigorous way.



## Ping-pong & Swimming & Exercising

<br>

Among the ball games, I am good at ping-pong, other ball games are at the elementary level like tennis, football, badminton, basketball. Swimming and exercising are also my favourite sports. 

## Reading

<br>

I read different types of book (physics, geography, history, novel) in my free time. But currently finding time to read at noon and evening is difficult for me due to the increasingly tight schedule
