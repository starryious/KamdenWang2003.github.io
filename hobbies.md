# Hobbies

<br>

## Animes

<br>

In my perspective, anime constructs entirely new worlds filled with diverse characters. Within these alternate realities, authors convey unique ideas and concepts that capture the imagination. Exceptional anime has the power to create immersive and captivating environments, allowing me to feel as though I've embarked on the same adventures as the protagonists. This sensation, though virtual, significantly shapes my perception of the world.

## Teaching

<br>

Teaching is another to learn. When you are teaching, you will subtbly find whether you truly master a specific knowledge or not. [The Feynman Technique](https://www.colorado.edu/artssciences-advising/resource-library/life-skills/the-feynman-technique-in-academic-coaching) is a way to practice this idea. Due to the unsatisfactory teaching of university courses, I want to try my best to teach others in a relaxing but rigorous way.

## Ping-pong & Swimming & Exercising

<br>

Among the ball games, I like playing ping-pong, other ball games are at the elementary level like tennis, football, badminton and basketball. Swimming and exercising are also my favorite sports. I spent 3 - 4 days a week in swimming and exercising.

## Reading

<br>

I am an omnivorous reader (physics, geography, history, novel). But currently finding time to read at noon and evening is difficult for me due to the increasingly tight schedule. I am interested in theoretical physics but getting bad score in high school.

## Miscellaneous

<br>

I enjoy drinking coffee, and watching movies; [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is the language I mainly use and previously I have learned MATLAB(forgotten), Python, C, C++, SQL and Wolfram (Mathematica); [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is the main tool I use for editing which combines Markdown, TeX, code chunks(like code cell in Jupyter Notebook and Mathematica Notebook) and using Pandoc to output different format.
