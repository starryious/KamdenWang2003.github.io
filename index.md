## Academic Interests

****

My interests primarily focus on applying solid mathematical knowledge, especially **probability theory and statistics** to develop stochastic and statistical models for addressing crucial real-world problems and interpreting real-world phenomena .

- Applied Probability, Stochastic Processes and Stochastic analysis

- Mathematical Statistics

Note that when we talk about **applied probability**, we are still inclined to the theoretical part, e.g., mathematical statistics, statistical physics, control theory, telecommunications, reliability, queueing theory, risk theory, prediction, filtering, financial mathematics, etc. On the other hand, **the application of probability** could be a theorem or a practical use.
