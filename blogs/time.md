## Time

Sometimes you would talk about time, for complaining, respecting or reflecting.

- Time is an "entrance ticket" for everything, that is to say, you cannot do anything without spending time. Maybe it can introduce another concept in economics -- [Opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost). Since one cannot manipulate the time, we need to utilize it, put it to the local maximum at least.
- Time is quick and slow at the same time (absoluteness of contradiction hhh). Everyone must have the same experience. It seems that we go through different scales of time when being different situations, Are we quantify time with consciousness ([Fourth Dimension â€” Spacetime?](https://medium.com/science-junction/fourth-dimension-spacetime-f7ef219f135d#:~:text=That hint was enough for,flows the same for everything.))
