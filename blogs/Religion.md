## Religion

- We are suppose to learn about religion, its background, system, etc rather than  believing in a certain religion. Religion indeed has its great value with a certain systematic and complete theory. However, it can restrict human's thought
- I believe that there is no "perfect" theory 
- Einstein summarizes this coexistence by writing that “**science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind**”
